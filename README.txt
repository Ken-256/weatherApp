This was a project I have done to learn about the implementations and use of API. 

This project is based on "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI&t=1689s&ab_channel=JonahLawrence%E2%80%A2DevProTips"

The thing that I added in my implementaion of the web app is:
	-what the current weather feels like
	-the current temperature in Â°F
	-current wind speed in mph
	
The API key is not included in the git, it can be claimed for free at "https://openweathermap.org/price"
